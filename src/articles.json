        "In our blockchain blog series, we take you along with us into the different aspects of blockchain technology. The series explains blockchain in simple steps, looking at the technology from different perspectives. The first blog introduces blockchain, simply describing what it is from a broader perspective. The second blog dives deeper into the primary mechanism of blockchain, explaining blocks, hashes and ultimately why it is considered such a safe technology.",
        "As we now know a little bit more about the basics of blockchain, for this third blog we dive deeper into the different forms of blockchain. This will help you understand what type of blockchain we use for our trading platform Beyco, and of course, why. Different forms? Are there multiple forms of blockchain? Yes! There is no such thing as one type of blockchain. Let us elaborate…",
        "Broadly speaking, there are three common varieties of blockchain: public, private and permissioned blockchains. Let’s start with the public blockchain. A public blockchain enables anyone and everyone to join and contribute to the network. Bitcoin is the most well-known cryptocurrency that runs on a public blockchain. Basically, Bitcoin is a digital currency that operates without a central bank. Normally, we have federal banks that are responsible for our monetary systems. Now Bitcoin does not have a single person or organization in charge! Bitcoin was created with the idea that everyone joining Bitcoin could “be their own bank” and no middlemen would be needed. This is the idea of a public blockchain: a public network where anyone can join whenever they want. There are no restrictions when it comes to participation. Next to Bitcoin, Ethereum is another example of a popular cryptocurrency that runs on a public blockchain. People appreciate a public blockchain for its true decentralization and anonymity as a user. Also, as everyone has a copy of the ledger on their computer, it creates a distributed nature as well.",
        "So, what is the difference with a private blockchain? With a private blockchain, only a single organization has authority over the network. So, it is not open for the public to join in. Private blockchains are mostly used for internal networking of a company and are considered not much different from a regular database.",
        "The third category of blockchains is permissioned blockchains. This type of blockchain can be seen as a mix between a public and private blockchain, with many customization options. For example, either anyone is allowed to join after verification of identity, or special permissions are given exclusively to parties performing certain activities. Permissioned blockchains have increased in popularity for supply chains, because of the ability to give specific permissions to each user on the network. So, for instance, certain participants may be given the authorization to see particular information, while others are allowed to view a broader range of information. This gives businesses participating in the blockchain the security to share certain information with others that they only want that party to see. Moreover, this blockchain type enables businesses to comply with international data protection or privacy rules!",
        "Now that we know more about these three types, what does this have to do with Beyco? If a blockchain network is used for coffee trading from origin to cup, the process involves multiple parties. Producers, exporters, importers, traders, roasters and service providers all serve a specific role to get the coffee from country of origin to the end consumer. Also, when trade finance is connected, financiers are also involved in the chain. In this case, a permissioned network is the best fit for a platform like Beyco.",
        "Why? First, the permissioned blockchain allows for verification of registrations. Beyco looks at every new registration and performs a Customer Due Diligence to make sure we facilitate a platform of trusted parties. This explains the name permissioned blockchain! It allows the facilitator to give permission for users to participate in the platform. Second, it makes sure every user is the owner of its own data. The permissioned blockchain enables users to record, own and manage their own data. Beyco is solely the independent non-profit facilitator of the platform. So, instead of a private blockchain in which one party records all the information, the permissioned blockchain network enables every user, whether this is a producer organization, roaster or trader, to themselves be the manager of their data. Third, it enables users to choose what information they would like to share and whatnot. So, users can choose to publicly share a contract or to have the contract only visible between the two parties who sign the contract. In this way, Beyco enables the recording of personal data and individual contracts between two parties. Details of such a contract are defined between both the buyer and seller."

        "In the run-up to the official launch of our Trader profile on Beyco, we are taking you into the world of coffee trade and the role of traders. In the previous blog of this series, we discussed the role of a trader from the perspective of specialty coffee producer organizations. We talked with Andy Carlton, managing director of Zombo Coffee Partners in Uganda, about his perspective on coffee traders and the good relationship Zombo has with partner This Side Up. For Zombo, This Side Up fulfills the role of bringing their coffee to the consumer market. A major advantage of selling their coffee to them is that they buy their coffee in one go, which they later distribute to individual roasters interested in Zombo Coffee. Selling and exporting coffee in bags to each separate roaster is incredibly expensive for a specialty coffee producer such as Zombo, so selling larger amounts to an importer who manages the logistics, storage and distribution ultimately saves money and makes trade more efficient.",
        "For this blog, we again discuss the role of a trader, but this time from the perspective of a roaster. We did an interview with Kerissa Narine, responsible for sourcing and impact at Wakuli. Wakuli is an Amsterdam based roaster that aims to build personal relationships with the producer organizations they work with to be able to not only buy their coffee, but also invest in improving field practices. In combination with paying a higher price, they want to enable a sustainable livelihood for the farming communities and ensure the continuation of growing the best tasting coffee. Like Zombo, Wakuli also works with This Side Up, who is the facilitating partner when they buy coffee from Zombo."
      ],
      "Sourcing and impact at Wakuli": [
        "Kerissa explains what it means to be responsible for sourcing and impact at Wakuli. “Essentially, my job is to develop sourcing relationships. This involves finding producer organizations or other partners to work with and look for coffees that we as Wakuli would like to buy. This also includes collecting data to track our impact from purchases. So, getting cost breakdowns from A to B, help manage logistics from A to B, and report and create content for customers and our team to be able to communicate these stories.”",
        "She further continues on the goal of Wakuli, stating: “Our impact goal at Wakuli is to increase value for farmers. We not only purchase coffee, but also aim to build a trust relationship with producer organizations and assist them with projects they work on to increase farmer income and improve farm practices. Of course, we can say that as much as we like, but when you go up to a group who has been promised these things so many times without proper result, it is hard to build up a good trusting relationship. The only way for us to confirm what we are saying is to show the numbers and verify it. That is why it is in our value to build trust. We try as much as possible to get alignment. So, coffee trade for us is very much a collaborative endeavour.”"
      ],
      "The role of a trader for Wakuli": [
        "For Wakuli, direct trade is an important aspect of their business. This means they directly communicate with, and buy coffee from, the producer organizations they have built strong relationships with. Of course, however, the transport of coffee from country of origin to the Netherlands requires logistics, insurance, risk management, warehousing and finance. Therefore, for transporting the coffee from the country of origin to the Netherlands, Wakuli works with valuable service providers.",
        "“We as Wakuli define direct trade as us knowing the producer. We agree on the price paid to the producer, we agree on a payment structure, and then we use valuable middlemen or service providers to get the coffee from A to B.”"
      ],
      "What is the added value of working with a trader for Wakuli?": [
        "Kerissa explains why Wakuli makes use of such service providers. “Because realistically, managing logistics for 15 origins is not feasible for a small company, but also not as efficient as if we do it through a valuable partner like This Side Up. That is why we use service providers. Our priority is that these service providers add value and that we can be transparent about the value that they add to farmers as well as customers and investors and the team. It is important that we are not ashamed that we pay to get the coffee delivered but provide the “why” of why we use a service provider; being transparent on why we use it!”",
        "About the role of traders, Kerissa shares: “I think that traders often come across as the “bad middlemen’’. The term trader has a dark tint to it. However, it is an unrealistic standard for anybody to think that direct trade is classified as a roaster buying directly from a farmer. Because, how about washing stations or milling costs, or exporters, or all the people in between that provide services that add value to the end product? A farmer would not be able to sell all the production of his farm and export that. That’s not how it works. Wakuli has the benefit of having a bit more scale. But as a small roaster who wants to make an impact, you cannot buy 5 bags directly from a farmer and pay for transport of a full container. That is very expensive.”",
        "“As a small roaster who wants to make an impact, you cannot buy 5 bags directly from a farmer and pay for transport of a full container. That is very expensive.”"
      ],
      "The relationship with This Side Up": [
        "Specifically on This Side Up, Kerissa shares that in a lot of ways they are what an ideal trader would look like, because they prioritize relationships. “We are in contact with producer organizations themselves. That, for us, is fundamental. That is, from our perspective, direct trade. We develop a relationship and together figure out how we can make coffee purchases happen. Sometimes, that is two years before we can start buying coffee. We need development before we start exporting together for the first time. As a small company it is quite hard to do that, but with This Side Up being the main trading partner, we could make these direct relations possible and align with their vision.”",
        "Kerissa then explains that This Side Up also creates impact by facilitating the movement of coffee from country of origin to Europe, which resonates with Andy’s perspective on the role of a trader. “By filling half of a container and making that container able to move, the other half can be filled with other coffee purchases”."
      ],
      "Other service providers": [
        "Besides This Side Up, Wakuli also works with service provider Algrano. Where This Side Up helps with sourcing and is also involved in building trust and relationships, Algrano assists Wakuli with logistics management. “We work with Algrano, which is not exactly the same as how we work with This Side Up. We do not really use them as a sourcing partner per se as we would do with This Side Up, but they help us with a lot of logistics management. Usually, we have a partner for coffees, we source them, we want to get them from A to B, and we use Algrano to help us make that possible. They are the service provider in this case.”"
      ],
      "Beyco Trader Profile": [
        "With the trader profile on Beyco, traders, or value chain facilitators, can be included in the trade to offer their services. Whether this is about coffee purchase or sales, logistics, finance, insurance or price risk management services, a trader can be involved or specifically be requested to provide a service. Ultimately, the idea is that Wakuli can purchase coffee from Zombo Coffee Partners through Beyco, with This Side Up as the facilitating partner in between. Beyco facilitates traceability of this supply chain, from the Zombo Coffee Partners, to This Side Up, to Wakuli. Traceability is maintained when This Side Up purchases coffee and sells this through to a roaster such as Wakuli. In this way, Beyco makes it possible to show where purchased coffee comes from, as well to whom it has been sold to. A trader as well as roaster can provide information to clients about the origin of its sourced coffee. Furthermore, this facilitates greater transparency of the coffee value chain!"

        "Our work at Progreso, including the development of Beyco and the Farmer App, would not be possible without the support of our partners. One particularly important partner of Progreso is Rabo Foundation. Progreso has a long-term relationship with Rabo Foundation, based on personal connections, similar values, and good collaboration. Like us, Rabo Foundation works for the benefit of smallholders to ultimately generate better prices, increase their income, and improve their quality of life.",
        "For this interview, we sat down with Verena Kenngott, Program Manager Latin America, and Julia Peters, Innovation Manager. Together, we discussed the importance of partnerships and why Rabo Foundation collaborates with Progreso, our Beyco Platform and Farmer app.",
        "Verena starts off the conversation by explaining the mission of Rabo Foundation: “Making improvements in smallholders’ lives, our ultimate beneficiaries. By kickstarting smallholder organizations: support them to get started, so that they can fly on their own afterwards. We start working with producer organizations when they are not eligible for finance yet, then we scale up together.” Rabo Foundation provides access to finance, knowledge, their network and innovative solutions. As organizations grow in volume and professionality, they can then move on to Rabo Rural Fund, where they can request loans of higher ticket sizes."
      ],
      "Create impact together": [
        "Verena: “The aim is to have long-term partnerships. Rabo Foundation has existed for 45 years. For us, it is important as the foundation of a large Agri-finance bank that we share knowledge, expertise, and networks, to get further together”. Rabo Foundation always seeks a partnership approach and as an impact financer, they provide finance on more flexible terms, often accompanied with (technical) support to the organization. This is the foundation of the long-term partnership between Progreso and the Rabo Foundation, Verena explains; “[Progreso knows] how to support producer organizations to improve their product quality, productivity in the field and work with them on their internal organization”.",
        "Verena continues; “Our ultimate goal is that the smallholder farmer has a better income, he has a better life, gets a better price for his product. You find players in the value chain who also have that aim, buyers who are able to pay a fair price, extra premium for the quality, and organizations like Progreso who really support them to improve their skills.”"
      ],
      "The importance of digitalization": [
        "As a Technical Assistance provider, Progreso manages a lot of projects financed by Rabo Foundation. And because of the long-term partnership, Rabo Foundation has been interested to start working with Beyco as well. Verena: “With Beyco we can even do more, as it brings efficiency and scale through which we can reach more organizations and have more impact.”",
        "Julia explains that they are seeing that innovation and digitalization in agriculture are getting more important, especially now events have been cancelled or postponed; “Now, in times of COVID-19, we see an increase in demand for digital solutions from our partners. There is a need to digitally connect with their funders or their buyers.”",
        "For Rabo Foundation it is important to understand how they can support their partners in digitalization. They see that digitalization is becoming more important for the connection between organizations, but also that their partners are looking for tools to keep up with the increasing demand for traceability.",
        "Julia: “Traceability is provided with the Farmer app and Beyco platform and we can understand the added value of the organization for the farmer. This is a great example of traceability managed through digital tools, adding value for the producer organizations and their members.”",
        "Verena adds; “Farmers and their organizations can share this information so we can learn from it and understand their needs. In this way, we get to know more about our ultimate beneficiaries, the smallholder farmer, but also learn about our impact. That is why it is so important to collaborate”.",
        "While digital tools may have been criticized in the past for replacing personal connections, Progreso and Rabo Foundation are convinced of the added value of digital tools in the agricultural sector. Julia: “Personal relations and digital tools are two things that complement each other.”"
